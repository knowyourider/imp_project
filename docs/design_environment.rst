Design Environment
===================

Some cheats we had to do to make things work both in the design environment work both locally, statically and to work statically on the server when referenced through wsgi as well as Apache.

Sym links for local static (from other documentation?)

CSS Background images
---------------------

We need bg css def in story pages in order to use variable names. We put the images in local_static/images/stories and use the local_static_sym describe above.

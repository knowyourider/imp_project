Install Python 3.6
--------------------

From Ocean Python: operate as a non-root "superuser" using sudo. Eriksson says either root or sudo. Going with root.

Test current built-in version on CentOS7 -- 2.7.5

Install tools
+++++++++++++

Ocean Python says to update yum
eApps Github says update yum and wget epel

Diving in, going to stick most closely to Eriksson, but first the updates, per Ocean Python
::
	yum update -y && yum upgrade -y
	# yum -y install yum-utils (already installed by the above)
	# yum groupinstall -y "development tools" (hit error)

Going back to eApps Github in case these are prerquisites.
Changed release-7-5 to 7-9
::
	# wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-9.noarch.rpm
	# rpm -ivh epel-release-7-9.noarch.rpm (already installed)
	# yum update -y && yum upgrade -y (nothing new)
	# dnf install redhat-rpm-config (command not found)

eApps support: cause was related to a missing configuration on the CentOS Plus repository required to install the kernel and its related packages.
They ran
::
	yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' --enablerepo=centosplus
So I ran groupinsall again
::
	yum groupinstall -y "development tools"
	> 1 packages excluded due to repository priority protections
	> Maybe run: yum groups mark install (see man yum)
	> No packages in any requested group available to install or update

Next line from Eriksson
::
	# Libraries needed during compilation to enable all features of Python:
	yum install -y zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel expat-devel

Install Python
++++++++++++++

Pay particular attention to the part in Eriksson about using the LDFLAGS as will be required by mod_wsgi
Dir to be in for the download: /usr/local/src
Check that all destinations exist before running.
::
	cd /usr/local/src
	# Python 3.6.1:
	wget http://python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/Python-3.6.1.tar.xz
	tar xf Python-3.6.1.tar.xz
	cd Python-3.6.1
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-shared LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib"
	make && make altinstall

      <blockquote>

        <p>Although it is now nearly ten years since this letter was written, its content is vivid in my memory. It was a demonstration of facts; an attempt to prove from them by the aid of analogical reasoning that these splendid footprints were those of extinct birds. The truth was before me, and unbiassed by preconceived notions I believed it; and I still maintain that these three letters, written without a ray of knowledge other than was derived from philosophical inductions, contain the fundamental principles and doctrines applied to the science of these organic remains. It needed not the subtleties of technical learning to comprehend their meaning&hellip;I did not indeed proceed to a mechanical arrangement into classes and orders, but the law of discovery was as fully exemplified by these perfect relics, as it now is after years of successful exploration&hellip;.  In a letter dated September 15th, 1835, [Hitchcock] informed me that in a paper he was about to publish, he should not fail to acknowledge his indebtedness to me for the first discovery. The performance of this pledge consisted in the remark, that 'his attention was first called to the subject' by me, but no mention whatever was made of my relations to the discovery.</p>
        
        <cite>Dr. James Deane, from a letter to Benjamin Silliman, November 1839.</cite>

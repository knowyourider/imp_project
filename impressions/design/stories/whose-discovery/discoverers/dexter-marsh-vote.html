      <h4>Your vote makes sense because...</h4>
      <p>Dexter Marsh recognized the birdlike character of the footprints and set them aside for further study. Although he did not write down his ideas, he looked for more such fossils and began to collect them. It is not clear what he would have done next if his neighbor, Dr. James Deane, had not written to Hitchcock and Silliman. He may have thought that Deane, as an educated man, might have more success in bringing attention to the footmarks.</p>

      <h4>But other votes are also valid because...</h4>
      <p>Pliny Moody made the first recorded discovery of these fossil footprints in modern times, so in that sense, he was first. However, his family kept them as a curiosity, and his discovery resulted in no knowledge or understanding of how and when they were made, or by what kind of animal. </p>

      <p>Native American<br>
      We know from the oral histories of various Native American tribes in the region that they saw the footprints and took an interest in them. A few instances of footprint petroglyphs have been found on rocks in this region and in Arizona, where similar footprints exist. Their discovery is outside the realm of the scientific practices developed in Europe, but it still was a discovery.</p>

      <p>Edward Hitchcock used empirical methods to establish that the footprints had been made by a birdlike animal, including measuring, counting anatomical parts, mapping the relationships of different tracks to each other, and making comparisons with footprints made by modern animals. He also accounted for the rock layer they were in, and knew from studying geology that no remains of birds had been found in such an old rock layer before. After making his investigations, he published the first article on the footprints. In the sciences, first publication is an important factor in claiming a discovery.</p>

      <p>James Deane acknowledged that other people saw the footprints before he did, but he was the first to recognize them as objects deserving of scientific study. He wrote down his theory of how they were made, drew pictures of them, and made plaster casts. He sent letters, drawings, and plaster casts of the prints to scientists and asked what they thought. He hoped his letter to Benjamin Silliman would be published in American Journal of Science.</p>

      <p>Roswell Field first saw the footprints many years after everyone else in this group, but he was the first to assert that they had been made by reptiles rather than birds. This is a clue that he was thinking of the bones being discovered in England and Europe that people were starting to call dinosaurs.</p>

      <p>Benjamin Silliman received three letters from James Deane. In the first two, Deane described his discovery. The third was accompanied by drawings and plaster casts, which finally convinced Silliman that the impressions were of scientific interest. He therefore asked Hitchcock to investigate further. Silliman made no claim to priority, but Hitchcock thought he was the only person, besides himself, who could make such a claim, because of his scientific training.</p>

      <p>William Draper may have seen the footprints before either Dexter Marsh or James Deane. The record is not clear. However, even if he was the first to see them, he claimed only to have shown them to other people. He made no investigations of his own and did not seek a geologist, naturalist, or other person with scientific training to see what they had to say.</p>

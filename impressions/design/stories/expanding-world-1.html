<p>The weather was mild enough in early March 1835 that &lt;<a class="pop_item" href="/supporting/fastfact/map-greenfield">Greenfield, Massachusetts</a>&gt;, a town of 1,500 souls tucked into the Connecticut River valley, was busy laying new sidewalks. Dexter Marsh, the town&rsquo;s handyman, was 29 years old, strong and vigorous. He had quarried sandstone from nearby Montague and used oxen or horses to haul it to Greenfield&rsquo;s Clay Hill, where Town Hall presided and, incidentally, he had built his own small home. He probably was &lt;prying a slab&gt; apart when he noticed what appeared to be footprints pressed into one side and the same exact shapes raised up on the facing slab he had just pulled away.</p>

<p>Dexter probably knew a little about rocks and fossils. He had grown up too poor to go to the local school, but he could read and had a furiously inquisitive mind. He could have read &lt;articles about geology in the local newspaper,&gt; because the town&rsquo;s inhabitants were as excited to learn about what was beneath the earth as we are today about explorations in space and the oceans. Besides, &lt;mammoth bones&gt; had been found in [which states] starting as early as 1705. Just a year before Dexter was born, the famous <a class="pop_item" href="/supporting/person/chas-w-peale/">Charles Willson Peale</a> had excavated a complete mammoth skeleton in a farmer&rsquo;s field about 100 miles away in eastern New York state.</p>

<p>But what Dexter Marsh saw in the sidewalk slab were not fossilized bones, but footprints that looked exactly like when a turkey steps into mud&mdash;but these were in rock! Marsh was mystified. So were his neighbors. One, a young physician named <a class="pop_item" href="/supporting/person/james-deane/">James Deane</a>, thought the discovery so curious that he wrote to two scientists, <a class="pop_item" href="/supporting/person/edward-hitchcock/">Edward Hitchcock</a> at &lt;Amherst College&gt; and <a class="pop_item" href="/supporting/person/benjamin-silliman/">Benjamin Silliman</a> at &lt;Yale College&gt;, to see what they thought.</p><p>More about this discovery can be found in another story on this website, &ldquo;Whose Discovery Was It?&rdquo;</p>

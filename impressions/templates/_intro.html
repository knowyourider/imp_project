  <h3><em class="subtitle">In which mysterious footprints are discovered in the rock in 19th century New England, are closely examined, and are concluded to be the tracks of an extinct race of gigantic birds that we now know as dinosaurs.</em></h3>

  <p>This website explores the mid-19th century discovery of strange, 3-toed footprints, later understood as dinosaur tracks, in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The significance of this first scientific discovery extended far beyond the emerging scientific community, with implications that had a profound effect not only on science but also on American religion, arts, and culture.</p>
